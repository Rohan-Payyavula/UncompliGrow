# Welcome to UncompliGrow

## Project info

UncompliGrow is a minimalist, gamified habit and goal-tracking web app that uses a visual tree metaphor to represent personal growth. The trunk symbolizes daily habits, the branches represent user-defined goals and subgoals, and leaves grow on those branches when tasks are completed. The roots at the bottom symbolize foundational wellness like rest, mindfulness, and balance.

This app is designed to encourage consistency, visual motivation, and personal development in a clutter-free, non-AI environment.

**Core Features:**
Trunk = Your core habits

Branches = Goals and subgoals

Leaves = Completed tasks (appear at their corresponding branches)

Roots = Foundational wellness actions

Progressive tree growth: As users complete habits, the tree widens dynamically
